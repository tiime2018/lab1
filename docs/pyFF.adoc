# Federation tools (Metadata aggregator + feed, discovery service)

[Rainer HÃ¶rbe]


## Revision: Roles of an federation operator (FO)

For a comprehensive definition see "Kantara Federation Operator Guidelines."
It encompasses the policy aspects of setting up the trust relationships and 
the operational and technical agenda.

Here we focus on the technical aspects of providing metadata. 
A minimalistic definition of this would be:
"The FO's operational roles are to administrate the list of federation participants,
and establish technical trust relationships between their SAML entities."

To enable scaleable federations OASIS defined the SAML Metadata IOP spec. 
This specification defines the metadata signature as trust anchor (opposed to using PKI).
Practically this means that the FO has to issue signed EntityDescriptors as an aggregator or MDQ service.


## Tool chain for an FO

- Metadata registration. There are several methods to confirm the authenticity and integrity of metadata:
 ** Plain text signatures in SMTP (a mix of blind signature and mutual trust ;-)
 ** Out-of-band validation using personal acquaintance
 ** Online submission with transport security (how are users enrolled?)
 ** Cryptographic signature (how are users enrolled?)
- Metadata validation
 ** It is useful to have a metadata profile to require administrators to supply optional, 
    but practically required elements.
 ** XML schema validation, or Online validation with http://mdval.test.portalverbund.at
- Metadata aggregation
- Metadata publishing
- Central IDP discovery service based on metadata (central vs. embedded)

## pyFF

This project provides a lean service with following features:

- Metadata aggregator
- MDQ service
- IDP discovery 
- PKCS11-Support
- Pipeline architecture with plug-in support
- OSS (https://github.com/leifj/pyFF)

## Using pyFF in this lab setting

- starting with the github project https://github.com/identinetics/d-pyff[identinetics/d-pyff]
- Docker scripting
- configuration:
  ** Pipeline definition
  ** Signing keys
  ** Starting the aggregator with Jenkins
  ** Discovery Service

## Using pyFF in a production environment

- System isolation, no signing on an internet-facing system
- Signing key protection, HSM
- Monitoring
